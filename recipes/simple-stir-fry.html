    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Do you ever have leftover ingredients you're not quite sure what to do with?
        Throwing everything together in a giant wok is a great solution! This is an
        extremely forgiving recipe that can be adjusted to your lifestyle and tastes.
    </p>

    <p>
        This recipe is fairly straight forward. You will need a protein, a grain, and vegetables.
        But each of these can be whatever is your favorite. I will choose my favorite ingredients for 
        this example.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 block of tofu</li>
        <li>1 large onion</li>
        <li>2 bell peppers</li>
        <li>1 cup of rice</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>First, prep your veggies. Thinly slice the onion and peppers.</li>
        <li>Rinse and start cooking the rice in a rice cooker.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large pan or wok. Add tofu first and fry for 5-10 minutes, until they become golden brown. Remove from pan.</li>
        <li>Add onion to wok for 3-5 minutes, then add peppers.</li>
        <li>Once veggies are cooked, combine ingredients.</li>
    </ol>
